# Installing Modweaver

!!! warning
    This page is a stub! Help out [on GitHub](https://github.com/modweaver/docs)

## Prerequisites
- Owning the game on Steam or Epic Games
    - Modding is not currently possible on Microsoft Store, Gamepass, or Console versions of the game. See [Modding Platforms](modding-platforms.md) for more info.

!!! warning
    Before running the below script, read over it and make sure you understand it. Never blindly run scripts!

Download and run the [Windows](https://cdn.ecorous.org/modweaver/install-windows.ps1) or the [Linux](https://cdn.ecorous.org/modweaver/install-linux.sh) script.

!!! warning
    If you install your Steam games in an unusual place, such as `D:\Games`, you will have to provide the path manually.
    You can find your Steam path by ++right-button++ on the game and going to Manage > Browse Local Files.

This should fully install Modweaver. Note that if you're on Linux, there are extra steps still. See [here](modding-platforms.md#linux)
