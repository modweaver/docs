# Getting Started

Here you'll get started making mods! First, make sure you meet all the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites

- Somewhat good knowledge of programming, especially C#. Don't come begging for help if you don't know C#
- [Visual Studio (Community) (free)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (NOT Visual Studio Code, they're different.) or [JetBrains Rider (paid)](https://jetbrains.com/rider/).
  - Note that Rider is usually quite a lot better than VS, but VS is free and Rider is not. You can get Rider [for free if you're a student or educator](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/), though.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or Mono equivalent if you're on Linux
- Owning the game on Steam or Epic Games
  - Modding is not currently possible on Microsoft Store, Gamepass, or Console versions of the game. See [Modding Platforms] for more info.
