# Getting Started

Here you'll get started making mods! First, make sure you meet all the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

## Prerequisites

---

- Somewhat good knowledge of programming, especially C#. Don't come begging for help if you don't know C#
- [Visual Studio (Community) (free)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (NOT Visual Studio Code, they're different.) or [JetBrains Rider (paid)](https://jetbrains.com/rider/).
  - Note that Rider is usually quite a lot better than VS, but VS is free and Rider is not. You can get Rider [for free if you're a student or educator](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/), though.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or Mono equivalent if you're on Linux
- Owning the game on Steam or Epic Games
  - Modding is not currently possible on Microsoft Store, Gamepass, or Console versions of the game. See [Modding Platforms](../users/modding-platforms.md) for more info.

First, you'll want to clone [the template repo](https://github.com/modweaver/modweaver-template.git)

You can do this through the Git CLI:

!!! warning
    Before running the below command, read over it and make sure you understand it. Never blindly copy commands into your terminal!

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/modweaver/template.git my/empty/project/dir
```

Open this project in your IDE (VS/Rider) and you're good to go!
